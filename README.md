An FPS-puzzle game where you control your characters eyes to detect abnormalities among game objects in a 3D-world. Abnormalities are game objects that aren't visible for both your eyes. By steering your character's left and right eye separately, you can align your eyes to easier detect these defects.

Made with Unity 5.4.2f2 using DOTween.
